Q5: Why are there no locks on the individual bedrooms in the NY homes?
It is a measure imposed by the New York Housing Department policy that prevents residential properties, like Cohabs, from installing bedroom door locks for fire safety purposes.
However, as explained in our golden rules, we provide safe and secure common spaces through trust and mutual respect of our community. These elements are key and part of our community's success.

Q6: What is included in my bedroom?
Our rooms are fully furnished, equipped, and have almost everything you need. We say almost because the only things we don’t provide are a blanket, sheets, and a pillow, so don’t forget to bring yours. Unless you’re moving to Paris where the blanket is provided for you. Prefer to travel light? You will have the option to subscribe to our Bedding Pack before moving in via the Cohabs app; we’ll take care of these for you.
